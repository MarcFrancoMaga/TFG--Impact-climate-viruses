⚙️ How It Works

This project's main goal is to analyze possible correlations between phage genomic data (viruses that infect bacteria) and meteorological conditions. Genomic data is extracted from PhagesDB and NOAA, and compared with weather data collected from NCBI. The entire analysis is performed using Python, utilizing data science and bioinformatics tools to process, visualize, and correlate the collected information.

Objectives

Retrieve genomic data of phages from PhagesDB and NOAA.

Extract meteorological information from NCBI.

Analyze patterns or correlations between climate variability and genomic changes observed in phages.

Visualize findings through graphs and reports.

🚀 Technologies Used

Python 3.10+

pandas, numpy: Data manipulation and analysis

biopython: Genomic sequence processing

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly: Data visualization

scikit-learn: Statistical modeling and analysis

requests, BeautifulSoup: Web scraping
